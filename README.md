## IoT Weather Monitoring System

### Problem Statement

Weather conditions have an impact on human activity, and weather monitoring can aid in activity control. It is critical to keep an eye on and monitor the weather patterns in the area. Users have limited access to weather information such as temperature, humidity, and heat index. Users will not be notified about  heat waves, or any other weather-related emergency if they do not have access to a weather station.

Furthermore, producing weather forecasts without data is challenging. When a person uses a weather station, they can also view the information's history. The trends in the measurements can be determined by the user. The user will be able to examine patterns more effectively as a result of this.
